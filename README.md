# odin-library
Welcome! This is the first JavaScript project in the NodeJS Path of The Odin Project. As its name suggests, this page is meant to be a library that displays a list of books and the details of each one and also allows the user to add new books that will be displayed as well.

You can also toggle the read status of the books to show that they're finished or that you're still reading them, or delete book entries if needed.
